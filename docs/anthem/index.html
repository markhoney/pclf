						<h2>Lyrics</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<pre>
								Verse 1:
								They march with banners high,
								The PCLF, with fire in their eyes.
								They'll take on Meenie's might,
								And end her oppressive plight.

								Chorus:
								PCLF, fighting for the future.
								PCLF, fighting for the cake.
								What the tyrant Meenie would deny us,
								The fighting PCLF will liberate.

								Verse 2:
								With ninja guards all around,
								Meenie's cakes are safe and sound.
								But the PCLF won't be deterred,
								Their mission must be preferred.

								Chorus:
								PCLF, fighting for the future.
								PCLF, fighting for the cake.
								What the tyrant Meenie would deny us,
								The fighting PCLF will liberate.

								Bridge:
								They'll storm the gates, they'll break the locks,
								The cakes will be free, and Meenie mocked.
								The people will feast, and raise their voice,
								For the PCLF, and the people's choice.

								Outro:
								PCLF, fighting for the future
								PCLF, fighting for the cake
								The tyrant Meenie is defeated
								The cakes are liberated, for heaven's sake!
							</pre>
